  <title>Overview of the Grizzly Framework</title>

  <section>
    <title>Goals of the Grizzly Framework</title>

    <para>Writing scalable server applications in the Java™ programming
    language has always been difficult. Before the advent of the Java New I/O
    API (NIO), thread management issues made it impossible for a server to
    scale to thousands of users. The Grizzly NIO framework has been designed
    to help developers to take advantage of the Java™ NIO API.</para>

    <para>Our hope is to help developers to build scalable and robust servers
    using NIO and we are also offering extended framework components such
    as:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>HTTP Prototcol framework for creating custom HTTP
        applications</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>HTP Server framework which offers high level abstractions to the
        HTTP protocol (not unlike Servlets)</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

  <section>
    <title>System Requirements</title>

    <para>The system requirements for Grizzly 2.0 are quite simple. Basically,
    Grizzly is able to run on any platform that <link
    xlink:href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html">JDK
    1.6</link> is available on.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Where to Get Help</title>

    <para>There are several ways to obtain help with Grizzly. The first
    resource is the <link
    xlink:href="https://grizzly.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">project
    mailing lists</link>. The Grizzly team is very responsive to any mails
    sent to these lists. The second resource is the <link
    xlink:href="https://grizzly.dev.java.net/issues/">project issue
    tracker</link>. If you find a bug with Grizzly, or have recommendations on
    how to improve Grizzly, this is the place to do it.</para>
