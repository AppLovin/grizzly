    <title>What is WebSockets?</title>

    <para>Quoting the description from <link
    xlink:href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455">RFC 6455</link>:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <para>The WebSocket Protocol is designed to supersede existing
      bidirectional communication technologies that use HTTP as a transport
      layer to benefit from existing infrastructure (proxies, filtering,
      authentication). Such technologies were implemented as trade-offs
      between efficiency and reliability because HTTP was not initially meant
      to be used for bidirectional communication (see [RFC6202] for further
      discussion). The WebSocket Protocol attempts to address the goals of
      existing bidirectional HTTP technologies in the context of the existing
      HTTP infrastructure; as such, it is designed to work over HTTP ports 80
      and 443 as well as to support HTTP proxies and intermediaries, even if
      this implies some complexity specific to the current environment.</para>
    </blockquote>

    <para>For futher details on the protocol itself, the RFC referenced
    previously is your best source of information.</para>

  <section xml:id="ws-overview">
    <title>Overview of Grizzly's WebSocket Implementation</title>

    <para>Grizzly 2 implements the requirements of RFC 6455, however we do
    include support for older versions of the protocol. This is particularly
    useful for clients that haven't caught up with the final draft of the
    specification. That said, please consider the support for the older
    versions to be deprecated in favor of pushing support for the final draft.
    The protocol versions supported at the time of writing are: 6, 7, 8, and
    13 (13 being the protocol version of the final draft). We do not support
    00/-76, so this may cause an issue with clients such as Safari which are
    still using this old version of the protocol.</para>

    <para>Like other protocols implemented with Grizzly 2.x, WebSocket support
    is implemented using a Filter. If you're not familiar with the concepts of
    Filters and FilterChains, please review the documentation in this guide.</para>

      to determine if the connection should be upgraded or not. Additional
      functionality can be added as required for the application - keep in
      mind that the WebSocketApplication is, itself, a WebSocketListener which
      will be added to each WebSocket registered with it. This allows handling
      all of the events exposed by WebSocketListener (as previously
      discussed). A word of caution - if overriding
      WebSocketApplication{onConnect,onClosed} be sure to make a call to the

    <title>Using Grizzly 2 WebSockets on the Server-Side</title>

    <para>In the previous sections we touched briefly how the WebSocket

    creating a WebSocket aware server and registering the WebSocketApplication
    with the WebSocket runtime.</para>

    <para>In this example, we'll be using Grizzly standalone (of course!). So
    first, we'll create the HttpServer and enable WebSocket support.</para>

    <programlisting>final HttpServer server = HttpServer.createSimpleServer("/var/www", 8080);
final WebSocketAddOn addon = new WebSocketAddOn();
for (NetworkListener listener : server.getListeners()) {
    listener.registerAddOn(addon);
}</programlisting>

    <para>That's all there is to it! Note, that you don't need to register the
    addon for all listeners, only those listeners that you want WebSocket
    support. </para>

    <para>Next, we instantiate a WebSocketApplication implementation (we don't
    go into the details of the implementation itself - that comes later) and
    register it with the WebSocket runtime.</para>

    <programlisting>final WebSocketApplication chatApplication = new ChatApplication();
WebSocketEngine.getEngine().register(chatApplication);</programlisting>

    <para>Again, simple! Once the server is started, it will be ready to
    service WebSocket requests. </para>
