    <title>What is WebSockets?</title>

    <para>Quoting the description from <link
    xlink:href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455">RFC 6455</link>:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <para>The WebSocket Protocol is designed to supersede existing
      bidirectional communication technologies that use HTTP as a transport
      layer to benefit from existing infrastructure (proxies, filtering,
      authentication). Such technologies were implemented as trade-offs
      between efficiency and reliability because HTTP was not initially meant
      to be used for bidirectional communication (see [RFC6202] for further
      discussion). The WebSocket Protocol attempts to address the goals of
      existing bidirectional HTTP technologies in the context of the existing
      HTTP infrastructure; as such, it is designed to work over HTTP ports 80
      and 443 as well as to support HTTP proxies and intermediaries, even if
      this implies some complexity specific to the current environment.</para>
    </blockquote>

    <para>For futher details on the protocol itself, the RFC referenced
    previously is your best source of information.</para>

    <title>Overview of Grizzly's WebSocket Implementation</title>

    <para>Grizzly 2 implements the requirements of RFC 6455, however we do
    include support for older versions of the protocol. This is particularly
    useful for clients that haven't caught up with the final draft of the
    specification. That said, please consider the support for the older
    versions to be deprecated in favor of pushing support for the final draft.
    The protocol versions supported at the time of writing are: 6, 7, 8, and
    13 (13 being the protocol version of the final draft). We do not support
    00/-76, so this may cause an issue with clients such as Safari which are
    still using this old version of the protocol.</para>

    <para>Like other protocols implemented with Grizzly 2.x, WebSocket support
    is implemented using a Filter. If you're not familiar with the concepts of
    Filters and FilterChains, please review the documentation in this guide.</para>

            <title>Broadcaster</title>
            <para>New in 2.3 is the concept of the <emphasis role="italic">Broadcaster</emphasis>.
                In previous versions of Grizzly's WebSocket implementation, when sending data, each
                call would result in a new frame instance being created.  This operation is
                expensive - particularly when sending such data to thousands of sockets.  An
                optimized Broadcaster implementation would frame the data once, and then send the
                framed result to each client.  The WebSocket interface mirrors the methods defined
                here in Broadcaster and the defautl implementation of the WebSocket interface merely
                delegates the call to the Broadcaster implementation.</para>
            <para>Here's what the Broadcaster API looks
                like:</para><programlisting>/**
 * Broadcasts the provided &lt;tt>text&lt;/tt> content to the specified recipients.
 * 
 * @param recipients the recipients of the provided &lt;tt>text&lt;/tt> content.
 * @param text       textual content.

 *
 * @param recipients the recipients of the provided &lt;tt>binary&lt;/tt> content.
 * @param binary     binary content.
 */
public void broadcast(final Iterable&lt;? extends WebSocket> recipients,
                      final byte[] binary);

/**
 * Broadcasts the provided fragmented &lt;tt>text&lt;/tt> content to the specified recipients.
 *
 * @param recipients the recipients of the provided fragmented &lt;tt>text&lt;/tt> content.
 * @param text       fragmented textual content.
 * @param last       &lt;tt>true&lt;/tt> if this is the last fragment, otherwise &lt;tt>false&lt;/tt>.
 */
public void broadcastFragment(final Iterable&lt;? extends WebSocket> recipients,
                              final String text,

 */
public void broadcastFragment(final Iterable&lt;? extends WebSocket> recipients,

            <para>As can be seen from the listing above, it is possible to send complete or
                fragmented messages in an optimized fashion.   It should be noted that, by default,
                Grizzly will use an unoptimized version of the Broadcaster (to maintain behavioral
                compatibility with previous releases).  In order to leverage the optimized version,
                see the following example:</para>
            <programlisting>public static class BroadcastApplication extends WebSocketApplication {
    private final Broadcaster broadcaster;

    public BroadcastApplication(Broadcaster broadcaster) {
        this.broadcaster = broadcaster;
    }


    @Override
    public WebSocket createSocket(ProtocolHandler handler,
                                  HttpRequestPacket requestPacket, 
                                  WebSocketListener... listeners) {
        final DefaultWebSocket ws =
                (DefaultWebSocket) super.createSocket(handler,
                requestPacket, listeners);
            
        ws.setBroadcaster(broadcaster);
        return ws;
    }
        
    @Override
    public void onMessage(WebSocket socket, String data) {
        socket.broadcast(getWebSockets(), data);
    }
}</programlisting>
            <para>The example is fairly staight forward.  A custom Broadcaster implementation is
                provided to the constructor of the WebSocketApplication instance.  When a new socket
                is created, this custom Broadcaster will provided and used by the various WebSocket
                broadcast calls.  Given this example, one can simply
                do:<programlisting>WebSocketApplication app = new BroadcastApplication(new OptimizedBroadcaster());</programlisting></para>

      <para>So to create a simple server-side WebSocket application, the developer, at a minimum,
                would extend this class.  It's no longer required nor recommended to override
                isApplicationRequest().  Applications should be registered with the WebSocketEngine
                with a url pattern (See section <link linkend="ws-api-engine">1.3.5</link> for
                details).  Additional functionality can be added as required for the application -
                keep in mind that the WebSocketApplication is, itself, a WebSocketListener which
                will be added to each WebSocket registered with it. This allows handling all of the
                events exposed by WebSocketListener (as previously discussed). A word of caution -
                if overriding WebSocketApplication{onConnect,onClosed} be sure to make a call to the
                super() so that the WebSocket is properly associated/unassociated with the
                application to prevent leaks.</para>

    <section xml:id="ws-api-engine">
      <title>WebSocketEngine</title>

      <para>The final piece of the API developers should understand is the
      WebSocketEngine. The WebSocketEngine is a JVM singleton in which all
      WebSocketApplications are registered. The methods of interest here are
      register/unregister:</para>

      <programlisting>/**
 * Register a WebSocketApplication to a specific context path and url pattern.
 * If you wish to associate this application with the root context, use an

 * &lt;/pre>
 *
 * @param contextPath the context path (per servlet rules)
 * @param urlPattern url pattern (per servlet rules)

public synchronized void register(String contextPath, String urlPattern, WebSocketApplication app) {
    ...
}

/**
 *
 * @deprecated Use {@link #register(String, String, WebSocketApplication)}

@Deprecated
public synchronized void register(WebSocketApplication app) {

      <para>Registration may occur at any time. For example, if this
      application is created/registered by a Servlet, then registration would
      happen in the Servlet.init() method and deregistration may happen within
      the Servlet.destroy() method. Regardless, the WebSocketApplication must
      be registered with the WebSocketEngine in order to be queried as part of
      the connection upgrade process.</para>

  <section xml:id="ws-server">
    <title>Using Grizzly 2 WebSockets on the Server-Side</title>

    <para>In the previous sections we touched briefly how the WebSocket
    protocol is implemented and the basic API. We'll now show the basics for
    creating a WebSocket aware server and registering the WebSocketApplication
    with the WebSocket runtime.</para>

    <para>In this example, we'll be using Grizzly standalone (of course!). So
    first, we'll create the HttpServer and enable WebSocket support.</para>

    <programlisting>final HttpServer server = HttpServer.createSimpleServer("/var/www", 8080);
final WebSocketAddOn addon = new WebSocketAddOn();
for (NetworkListener listener : server.getListeners()) {
    listener.registerAddOn(addon);
}</programlisting>

    <para>That's all there is to it! Note, that you don't need to register the
    addon for all listeners, only those listeners that you want WebSocket
    support. </para>

    <para>Next, we instantiate a WebSocketApplication implementation (we don't
    go into the details of the implementation itself - that comes later) and
    register it with the WebSocket runtime.</para>

    <programlisting>final WebSocketApplication chatApplication = new ChatApplication();
WebSocketEngine.getEngine().register(chatApplication, "/chat");</programlisting>

    <para>Again, simple! Once the server is started, it will be ready to
    service WebSocket requests. </para>

    <para>For a more concrete (and runnable) example, review this simple <link
    xlink:href="http://java.net/projects/grizzly/sources/git/show/samples/websockets/chat?rev=afc47689a5c16663bc6a574e1ee2962d349cda2e">WebSocket
    Chat</link> application.</para>

  <section xml:id="ws-client">
    <title>Grizzly WebSockets Client</title>

    <para>The Grizzly project does have a WebSocket client if such
    functionality is needed. Instead of repeating what has already been
    written, we'll recommend that you read the following <link
