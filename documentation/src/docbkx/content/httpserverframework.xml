    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>The Grizzly 2.0 HTTP server framework builds off the HTTP codec
    framework to provide a more useful abstraction for day-to-day work. At a

              HTTP-related features such as Comet, WebSockets, the chunked
              transfer-encoding, etc. HttpServer can support multiple
              NetworkListeners. Also, keep in mind that all HttpHandlers added

    <section>
      <title>Quick Start</title>

      <para>To get started with the HTTP server framework you'll need to
      include the module in your project:</para>

      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;dependencies&gt;
    &lt;dependency&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;org.glassfish.grizzly&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;grizzly-http-server&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;version&gt;2.0.0&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;/dependencies&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>Once the dependencies are in place, the absolute simplest, albeit
      not-very-useful, server one can create is:</para>

      <programlisting language="java">HttpServer server = HttpServer.createSimpleServer();
try {
    server.start();
    System.out.println("Press any key to stop the server...");
    System.in.read();
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.err.println(e);
}</programlisting>

      <para>This will create a Grizzly HTTP server listening on 0.0.0.0:8080
      and will serve content from the directory in which the JVM was started.
      As stated before, while this demonstrates the ease of embedding Grizzly,
      it's not very useful.</para>

      <para>Let's add a HttpHandler to server the current time.</para>

      <programlisting language="java" linenumbering="numbered">HttpServer server = HttpServer.createSimpleServer();
server.getServerConfiguration().addHttpHandler(
    new HttpHandler() {
        public void service(Request request, Response response) throws Exception {
            final SimpleDateFormat format = new SimpleDateFormat("EEE, dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss zzz", Locale.US);
            final String date = format.format(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis()));
            response.setContentType("text/plain");
            response.setContentLength(date.length());
            response.getWriter().write(date);
        }
    },
    "/time");
try {
    server.start();
    System.out.println("Press any key to stop the server...");
    System.in.read();
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.err.println(e);
}</programlisting>

      <para>Line 2 adds a new HttpHandler (think Servlet) to service requests
      make to /time. Any other requests to the server will be considered
      requests for static content served from the direction in which the JVM
      was started.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Long-lasing HTTP requests (suspend/response)</title>

    <para>Some HTTP interactions may need to trigger a long running
    transaction on the server and wait for the result to generate a response.
    However, this can be problematic with an NIO-based server as there are
    generally a handful of threads servicing all requests. A long running
    transaction in this case would tie up one of the processing threads
    preventing it from servicing other requests. If enough of these long
    running transactions were initiated, it could lead to a denial of
    service.</para>

    <para>To support these use cases without negatively impacting the server,
    Grizzly allows a response to be suspended until such time that the long
    running task is complete and the response is ready to be generated.</para>

    <para>Let's cover the methods related to response suspend/resume. The
    following methods are available on the Response object itself:</para>

    <programlisting language="java">    /**
     * Suspend the {@link Response}. Suspending a {@link Response} will
     * tell the underlying container to avoid recycling objects associated with
     * the current instance, and also to avoid committing response.

     * Suspend the {@link Response}. Suspending a {@link Response} will

     * @param timeout The maximum amount of time,
     * a {@link Response} can be suspended. When the timeout expires (because
     * nothing has been written or because the {@link Response#resume()}
     * or {@link Response#cancel()}), the {@link Response} will be automatically
     * resumed and committed. Usage of any methods of a {@link Response} that
     * times out will throw an {@link IllegalStateException}.

    <para>The "Suspended Response Queue" warrants some explaination. If a
    suspended Response has defined a timeout, it will be added to the
    "Suspended Response Queue". When the queue is processed, the current time
    will be evaluated against the timeout as defined within the Response's
    SuspendContext. If the timeout has been exceeded, the response will be
    committed and the Response object within the queue will be marked for
    removal. So in the case no timeout has been defined, the response will not
    be added to the queue, and the task may run indefiniately.</para>

    <title>NIO Streams</title>

    <para>In Grizzly 1.9, it was possible to write data to the client using
    non-blocking I/O, however, when reading post data from within a
    GrizzlyAdapter implementation, all I/O in that case was blocking. In
    Grizzly 2.0, it's very simple using the InputStream/Reader from the
    request and read data in a non-blocking manner. As far as writing, all I/O
    will be written in non-blocking mode, but there is some extra features on
    the OutputStream vended by the Response instance that will be covered that
    expose advanced non-blocking operations.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Non-Blocking Writing</title>

      <para>The methods getOutputStream() and getWriter() on Response return
      instances of NIOOutputStream and NIOWriter. In addition to the methods
      defined by java.io.OutputStream and java.io.Writer, these entities both
      implement the NIOOutputSink interface.</para>

      <programlisting language="java">/**
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This interface defines methods to allow an {@link java.io.OutputStream} or

}</programlisting>

      <para>The typical flow when using these methods is to call canWrite()
      with the desired length. Whether or not the desired amount of data will
      depened, primarily, on the configuration value of maxPendingWrites
      property on the NetworkListener being used to process the current
      request. </para>

      <para>For example, if the client is on a slow connection, and the OS
      network buffer is full, the write queue maintained by the Transport
      implementation would start to full up. If an attempt to write is made
      that will exeed the queue limit, a
      PendingWriteQueueLimitExceededException will be thrown. However, if the
      developer calls canWrite() with the desired length, and the return value
      is false, then it is know there, that the write would fail. This
      condition can be gracefully be handled by calling notifyCanWrite()
      providing a WriteHandler and the desired length. Once the pending write
      queue drains enough to support the length, the WriteHandler will be
      notified to allow the developer to continue sending content to the
      client.</para>

      <para>For Grizzly 2.0 HTTP applications that deal in primarily binary
      data and are using Grizzly Buffers, they can leverage an additional
      method available on the NIOOutputStream specified by the
      BinaryNIOutputSink interface. This interface allows the direct writing
      of Buffer instances. This optimizes away the need to copy bytes to a
      Buffer implementation under the covers.</para>

      <para>The general idea behind non-blocking writes holds true for
      non-blocking reads. The developer can check to see if data is available
      to be read without blocking by calling isReady() or checking for a
      non-zero return from readyData(). If no data can be read without
      blocking, use notifyAvailable(ReadHander) or
      notifyAvailable(ReadHandler, int). When data is becomes available, the
      ReadHandler will be invoked. Note that if no length is provided to the
      notifyAvailable() methods, the ReadHandler will be invoked as soon as
      any data becomes available. In this case, it's a good idea to check how
      much can be read by another call to readyData(). </para>
