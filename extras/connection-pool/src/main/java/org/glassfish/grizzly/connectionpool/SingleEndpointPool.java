/**
 * The single endpoint {@link Connection} pool implementation, in other words

 * 
 * The endpoint address has to be represented by an objected understandable by
 * a {@link ConnectorHandler} passed to the constructor. For example the
 * endpoint address has to be represented by {@link SocketAddress} for
 * {@link TCPNIOConnectorHandler} and {@link UDPNIOConnectorHandler}.
 * 
 * There are number of configuration options supported by the <tt>SingleEndpointPool</tt>:
 *      - <tt>corePoolSize</tt>: the number of {@link Connection}s to be kept in the pool and never timed out
 *                      because of keep-alive setting;
 *      - <tt>maxPoolSize</tt>: the maximum number of {@link Connection}s to be kept by the pool;
 *      - <tt>keepAliveTimeoutMillis</tt>: the maximum number of milliseconds an idle {@link Connection}
 *                                         will be kept in the pool. The idle {@link Connection}s will be
 *                                         closed till the pool size is greater than <tt>corePoolSize</tt>;
 *      - <tt>keepAliveCheckIntervalMillis</tt>: the interval, which specifies how often the pool will
 *                                               perform idle {@link Connection}s check;
 *      - <tt>reconnectDelayMillis</tt>: the delay to be used before the pool will repeat the attempt to connect to
 *                                       the endpoint after previous connect had failed.
