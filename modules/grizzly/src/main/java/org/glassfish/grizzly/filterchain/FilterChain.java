/**
 * <p>
 * This class implement the "Chain of Responsibility" pattern (for more info, 
 * take a look at the classic "Gang of Four" design patterns book). Towards 
 * that end, the Chain API models a computation as a series of "protocol filter"
 * that can be combined into a "protocol chain". 
 * </p><p>
 * The API for Filter consists of a two set of methods (handleXXX() and
 * postXXX) which is passed a "protocol context" parameter containing the
 * dynamic state of the computation, and whose return value is a
 * {@link NextAction} that instructs <tt>FilterChain</tt>, how it should
 * continue processing. The owning ProtocolChain  must call the
 * postXXX() method of each Filter in a FilterChain in reverse
 * order of the invocation of their handleXXX() methods.
 * </p><p>
 * The following picture describe how it Filter(s) 
 * </p><p><pre><code>
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * - Filter1.handleXXX() --> Filter2.handleXXX()                    |          -
 * -                                                                |          -
 * -                                                                |          -
 * -                                                                |          -
 * - Filter1.postXXX() <-- Filter2.postXXX()                        |          -
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * </code></pre></p><p>
 * The "context" abstraction is designed to isolate Filter
 * implementations from the environment in which they are run 
 * (such as a Filter that can be used in either IIOP or HTTP parsing, 
 * without being tied directly to the API contracts of either of these 
 * environments). For Filter that need to allocate resources prior to 
 * delegation, and then release them upon return (even if a delegated-to 
 * Filter throws an exception), the "postXXX" method can be used
 * for cleanup.
