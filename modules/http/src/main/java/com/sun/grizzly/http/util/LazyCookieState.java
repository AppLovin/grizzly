 * Lazy cookie implementation, which is based on preparsed Grizzly {@link Buffer}s.

 * 
 *  Allows recycling and uses Buffer as low-level
 *  representation ( and thus the byte-> char conversion can be delayed
 *  until we know the charset ).
 *
 *  Tomcat.core uses this recyclable object to represent cookies,
 *  and the facade will convert it to the external representation.
