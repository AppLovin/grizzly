FilterChain and Filters
=======================

In the previous sections we mentioned the *Processor*, and its role -
processing I/O events occurred on Grizzly *Connection*s. The
*FilterChain* is the most useful type of *Processor* used in Grizzly.

![""](images/coreframework/filterchain-diagram.png)

*FilterChain*, according to its name, is a chain of *Filter*s. Each
*Filter* represents a unit of processing work to be performed, whose
purpose is to examine and/or modify the state of the transaction that is
represented by a *FilterChainContext*.

To give an idea how *FilterChain* may look like, here is example of
*FilterChain*, which implements HTTP server logic:

![""](images/coreframework/http-filterchain.png)

-   TransportFilter is responsible to read data from network
    *Connection* to a *Buffer*, and to write data from *Buffer* to a
    nework *Connection*

-   HttpFilter is responsible for *Buffer* \<-\> *HttpPacket*
    transformation (both directions)

-   HttpServerFilter is responsible for processing request *HttpPacket*s
    and generating response *HttpPacket*s and send them back on
    *FilterChain* in opposite direction
    (HttpServerFilter-\>HttpFilter-\>TransportFilter).

So, what if we want to implement HTTPS server? It's simple:

![""](images/coreframework/https-filterchain.png)

we add just one SSLFilter, responsible for encoding/decoding SSL secured
data.

As we see, during the processing of any I/O Event, Filters in a
FilterChain will be executed in the certain order. **It's important to
remember that the most of I/O Events are processed starting from first
filter to last (from left to right on the schema above), except WRITE
event, whose processing starts from last Filter in chain to first (from
right to left a the schema above).**

Let's define some **terminology** to make the following descriptions
clearer:

-   **Upstream** - direction from this Filter to the last Filter in
    chain (from left to right on the schema above);

-   **Downstream** - direction from this Filter to the first Filter in
    chain (from right to left on the schema above);

Let's take a look which I/O events could be processed by a
*FilterChain*, for that purpose we can just take a look at the *Filter*
interface methods:

```java
public NextAction handleRead(FilterChainContext ctx) throws IOException;

public NextAction handleWrite(FilterChainContext ctx) throws IOException;

public NextAction handleConnect(FilterChainContext ctx) throws IOException;

public NextAction handleAccept(FilterChainContext ctx) throws IOException;

public NextAction handleClose(FilterChainContext ctx) throws IOException;
```

so I/O events are

-   READ: data is available from a Connection, which could be read and
    processed;

-   WRITE: data is going to be written to a Connection and the Filter
    might be responsible to transform data representation form, like
    *HttpPacket* -\> *Buffer* on schema above;

-   CONNECT: new client *Connection* has been connected;

-   ACCEPT (TCP only): new client *Connection* has been accepted by
    server *Connection* (*TCPNIOServerConnection*);

-   CLOSE: the Connection has been closed (either locally or by peer);

**It's important to remember that the same I/O events on the specific
Connection are processed serially. For example, if we process READ I/O
event on Connection "A", Grizzly will never start processing another
READ I/O event on the same Connection "A" until the processing of the
previous READ I/O event has completed processing. If the user decides to
take ownership of I/O event processing, then the "rule" of serial event
processing should still be observed.**

Additionally FilterChain Filters are able to initiate and handle custom
event notifications. The event initiator may choose to emit the event
upstream or downstream by FilterChain like:

```java
public NextAction handleRead(FilterChainContext ctx) throws IOException {
        // Here we decide to notify downstream Filters
        ctx.notifyDownstream(new OneEvent(...));

        // Notify upstream Filters
        ctx.notifyUpstream(new AnotherEvent(...));
}
```

The Filters in FilterChain are able to intercept and process custom
Events by implementing method:

```java
public NextAction handleEvent(FilterChainContext ctx, FilterChainEvent event) throws IOException;
```

As we see each Filter "handle" method has FilterChainContext parameter
and returns NextAction result.

-   **FilterChainContext**

    ![""](images/coreframework/filterchaincontext.png)

    FilterChainContext represents a context (state), associated with
    processing of specific I/O event on the specific Connection, so its
    lifecycle is bound to the processing of a single I/O event.

    FilterChainContext contains following state information:

    -   **Connection**

        The Connection I/O event occurred on;

    -   **Address**

        The peer address. In most cases it returns the same value as
        *Connection.getPeerAddress()*, except in the case when we handle
        a READ event on unbound UDP Connection. In this case, the
        *FilterChainContext.getAddress()* will return the address of
        peer, which sent data;

    -   **Message**

        The message being processed. This is the only value Filters may
        change during the I/O event processing. Usually it is used
        during the incoming/outgoing message parsing/serializing. Each
        Filter is able to take initial message data, transform it to a
        different representation, set it back and pass processing to the
        next Filter in chain.

        For example, when handling READ event, HttpFilter gets message
        from FilterChainContext as Grizzly Buffer, transforms it to a
        HttpPacket, sets HttpPacket back to FilterChainContext message
        and passes control to a HttpServerFilter, which will get
        HttpPacket from the FilterChainContext and process it.

    In addition to holding the state, the FilterChainContext provides
    support for commonly used I/O operations:

    -   **Read**

            ReadResult readResult = ctx.read();

        This operation performs a blocking FilterChain read starting at
        the first Filter in chain (inclusive) upstream to this Filter
        (exlusive).

        The operation will return a result, when processing of READ I/O
        event will reach the current Filter and FilterChain will be
        about to call handleRead(...) operation of this Filter.

    -   **Write**

            `ctx.write(message);`

            or

            `ctx.write(message, completionHandler);`

            or

            `ctx.write(address, message, completionHandler);  // Unbound UDP only`

        This operation performs a non-blocking FilterChain write
        starting at this Filter (exclusive) downstream to the first
        Filter (inclusive). This operation initiates processing of WRITE
        I/O event on the FilterChain starting from this Filter
        (exclusive).

    -   **Flush**

            `ctx.flush();`

            or

            `ctx.flush(completionHandler);`

        This operation initializes and notifies downstream filters about
        special *TransportFilter.FlushEvent* so each Filter is able to
        handle this event and make sure all the cached data was written
        on the Connection.

    -   **Event notification**

            `ctx.notifyUpstream(event);`

            or

            `ctx.notifyDownstream(event);`

        This operation notifies all the upstream/downstream Filters in
        the FilterChain about specific *FilterChainEvent*.

-   **NextAction**

    As stated previously, during processing of an I/O Event, the
    FilterChain is calling Filters one by one from first to last except
    WRITE event, which is being processed from last Filter to first. At
    the same time Filters can change the default I/O Event processing
    order by returning different types of NextAction:

    -   **StopAction**

            `return ctx.getStopAction();`

        instructs the FilterChain to stop the processing of this I/O
        Event. Usually StopAction is returned when there isn't enough
        data to continue FilterChain processing, or it's the last Filter
        in the chain.

        The StopAction could be parameterized:

            `return ctx.getStopAction(incompleteChunk);`

            or

            `return ctx.getStopAction(incompleteChunk, appender);`

        An incompleteChunk in StopAction means there isn't enough data
        to continue FilterChain processing. As more data becomes
        available but before FilterChain calls the Filter, it will check
        if the Filter has any data stored after the last invocation. If
        an incompleteChunk is present it will append the new data to the
        stored one and pass the result as the FilterChainContext
        message.

        Note: the incompleteChunk should be "appendable", so the
        FilterChain will know how new data chunk should be appended to
        the stored one. So the incompleteChunk should either implement
        *org.glassfish.grizzly.Appendable* or
        *org.glassfish.grizzly.Appender* should be passed as additional
        parameter.

    -   **InvokeAction**

            `return ctx.getInvokeAction();`

        instructs the FilterChain to run next Filter in chain according
        to the natural execution order.

        It's possible to create the InvokeAction with an
        ***incompleteChunk*** parameter:

            `return ctx.getInvokeAction(incompleteChunk, appender);`

        this instructs the FilterChain to store the incompleteChunk and
        continue FilterChain execution like it was with
        non-parameterized version.

        This feature is particularly useful for those cases a message or
        several messages are parsed from the source Buffer and discover
        that there is a remainder whose data is not enough to transform
        to an application message. So the developer can continue the
        FilterChain processing with the message(s) that were parsed and
        store the incompleteChunk remainder. As more data becomes
        available but before FilterChain calls the Filter again, it will
        check if the Filter has any data stored after the last
        invocation. If an incompleteChunk is present it will append the
        new data to the stored one and pass the result as the
        FilterChainContext message.

        Note: the incompleteChunk should be "appendable", so the
        FilterChain will know how new data chunk should be appended to
        the stored one. So the incompleteChunk should either implement
        *org.glassfish.grizzly.Appendable* or
        *org.glassfish.grizzly.Appender* should be passed as additional
        parameter.

        Another option is to create the InvokeAction with an
        ***unparsedChunk*** parameter:

            `return ctx.getInvokeAction(unparsedChunk);`

        this instructs the FilterChain to store the unparsedChunk and
        continue FilterChain execution like it was with
        non-parameterized version. Unlike in the "incompleteChunk" case
        described above, this time we don't know if unparsedChunk has
        enough data to transform to application message(s) or not. Once
        the FilterChain execution completes, the unparsedChunk of the
        most recent Filter in chain will be restored FilterChain
        processing will be re-initialed immediately starting from the
        Filter which stored the unparsedChunk.

        This feature is particularly useful for those cases a message is
        parsed from the source Buffer and discover that the Buffer
        contains a remainder, which may or may not contain more
        messages. This allows the developer to extract the first message
        and save the remainder to be processed after the current message
        processing has been completed.

    -   **RerunFilterAction**

            `return ctx.getRerunFilterAction();`

        Instructs the FilterChain to re-run this Filter one more time.
        This can useful to simplify I/O event processing code and avoid
        recursions.

    -   **SuspendAction**

            `return ctx.getSuspendAction();`

        Instructs the FilterChain to terminate (leave) the I/O event
        processing in the current thread. The user will be able to
        resume the I/O event processing by calling

        -   *ctx.resume()*: resumes processing at the same Filter it was
            suspended.

        -   *ctx.resume(NextAction)*: resumes processing at the same
            Filter it was suspended, but instead of passing control to
            the Filter - it simulates the Filter processing completion
            like if it returned NextAction as the result

        -   *ctx.resumeNext()*: resumes processing at the Filter next to
            the Filter it was suspended at. Same as
            *ctx.resume(ctx.getInvokeAction())*.

        Please note, after returning SuspendAction and before I/O event
        processing will be resumed, Grizzly [won't
        initialize](#fc-serial-rule) the same I/O event processing on
        the same Connection. For example if we return the SuspendAction
        during READ event processing - Grizzly won't notify the
        FilterChain about any new data coming on the same Connection,
        until READ event of the suspended event has been completed.

    -   **ForkAction (was SuspendStopAction)**

            return ctx.getForkAction();

        This NextAction is very similar to
        [SuspendAction](#suspend-action), except for one important
        thing. After getting ForkAction, Grizzly will keep listening for
        the same I/O events on the Connection and notify FilterChain if
        they occur.

        Special care should be taken with this NextAction to ensure that
        two or more threads are not processing the same I/O operation
        simultaneously.
