Writing scalable server applications in the Java™
programming language has always been difficult. Before the advent of the Java
New I/O API (NIO), thread management issues made it impossible for a server to
scale to thousands of users. The Grizzly NIO framework has been designed to help
developers to take advantage of the Java™ NIO API. Grizzly's goal is to help
developers to build scalable and robust servers using NIO as well as offering extended
framework components: Web Framework (HTTP/S), WebSocket, Comet, and more!
