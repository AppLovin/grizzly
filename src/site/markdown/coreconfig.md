## Core Configuration

The primary points of configuration of the core framework are that of
the Transport instances and their associated thread pools. The ability
to configure both entities is possible via the NIOTransportBuilder.

## Transport Configuration

Just as there are concrete NIOTransport implementations for TCP and UDP,
so too are there two concrete NIOTransportBuilder implementations. Each
NIOTransportBuilder implementation exposes configurable features unique
to each transport. The following describes configuration properties
common to all NIOTransports and then describes the properties for the
TCP and UDP NIOTransport implementations.

## Thread Pool Configuration

Grizzly's thread pool configuration is managed by the ThreadPoolConfig
object:

</table>

The thread pool configuration is fairly straight forward. However, it
should be noted that Grizzly, internally, has several thread pool
implementations: SyncThreadPool, FixedThreadPool, and
QueueLimitedThreadPool. Which implementation is chosen is based on the
configuration. The following sections describe each of the thread pool
implementations.

### FixedThreadPool

This pool will be selected when the queueLimit property is less than
zero, and the max and core pool sizes are the same. The FixedThreadPool
has no synchronization when executing tasks, so it offers better
performance.

### QueueLimitedThreadPool

This pool will be selected when the queueLimit property is greater than
zero, and the max and core pool sizes are the same. The
QueueLimitedThreadPool is an extension of the FixedThreadPool, so if
offers the same benefits of the FixedThreadPool without having an
unbounded task queue.

### SyncThreadPool

This pool will be selected when none of the criteria for the other
thread pools apply. This thread pool does have synchronization to have
precise control over the decision of thread creation.

## Examples

Here are some examples of using the TCPNIOTransportBuilder to configure
the Transport and/or thread pool.

```java
final TCPNIOTransportBuilder builder = TCPNIOTransportBuilder.newInstance();
final TCPNIOTransport transport = builder.build();
```

Creates a new TCPNIOTransport using all default configuration values.

```java
final TCPNIOTransportBuilder builder = TCPNIOTransportBuilder.newInstance();
final TCPNIOTransport transport = builder.setIOStrategy(SameThreadIOStrategy.getInstance()).setTcpNoDelay(true).build();
```

Creates a new TCPNIOTransport instance using the SameThreadIOStrategy,
and tcp-no-delay set to true. Note that configuration calls can be
chained.

```java
final TCPNIOTransportBuilder builder = TCPNIOTransportBuilder.newInstance();
final ThreadPoolConfig config = builder.getWorkerThreadPoolConfig();
config.setCorePoolSize(5).setMaxPoolSize(5).setQueueLimit(-1);
final TCPNIOTransport transport = builder.build();
```

This example will configure the TCPNIOTransport to use the
FixedThreadPool implementation due to the fact that there is no queue
limit and the core and max pool sizes are the same.
